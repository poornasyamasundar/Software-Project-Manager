            -a field telling the average amount of time between the end of a scrum(sprint) and start of another scrum(sprint)( the average number will be given)
     -Create a button called Timeline in the left side options, upon clicking the button the following should be displayed

6)Progress for spiral model:
        -There should be two progress bars, one for the amount of time completed in the current circle and one for the current phase.

        -average time spent on each circle.
        -average amount of time between two circles.
